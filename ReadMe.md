# Tech stack
[Java](https://www.java.com/en/) - is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

# Installation
Please note that you need to have Java JDK installed.
1. Java Development Kit (JDK) is an essential set of tools for Java application development and execution. These tools include the Java compiler, the Java core libraries, and other utilities required to develop and run Java applications.
2. To install Java JDK, please follow the steps below:
Visit the official Oracle Java website to download the [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
3. Select the appropriate JDK version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and download the installation file.
4. Once the file is downloaded, run it and follow the on-screen installation instructions. You can either use the default settings or customize them according to your preferences.
5. After the installation is complete, make sure that the *JAVA_HOME* environment variable is correctly set on your system. This is necessary for the application to locate the JDK correctly. You can find more information on how to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable in the Java documentation.
6. Once you have finished installing Java JDK, you will be able to execute java programs.

### Clone the repositories
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/catalyn98/JavaProgrammingMasterclass.git
```

### Run from command line
To compile and run a Java program from the command prompt, you can follow these steps:
1. Open the command prompt:
- On Windows: Press Win + R, type "cmd" and press Enter.
- On macOS or Linux: Open the Terminal application.
2. Navigate to the directory where your Java source file is located. Use the cd command followed by the directory path. For example:
`cd C:\path\to\your\directory`
3. Compile the Java source file using the *javac* command followed by the file name with the *.java* extension. For example:
`javac YourProgram.java`
If the compilation is successful, it will generate a bytecode file named *YourProgram.class*.
4. Run the compiled Java program using the *java* command followed by the class name (without the *.class* extension). For example:
`java YourProgram`
Make sure you provide the correct class name, including the proper capitalization. The Java program will execute, and you should see the output or any error messages in the command prompt.

# Credit
These Java programs was developed based on a comprehensive tutorial on Udemy titled **"Java Programming Masterclass updated to Java 17"** by Tim Buchalka. You can find the tutorial [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/).

### Description
The tutorial provided a thorough introduction to Java programming, covering essential concepts and principles of Object-Oriented Programming. It covered topics such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Through hands-on exercises and practical examples, the tutorial offered a solid foundation in Java programming and helped me gain a clear understanding of OOP principles.
By following the tutorial, I acquired essential Java skills, including how to write clean and efficient code, structure programs using classes and objects, and leverage the power of inheritance and polymorphism. The tutorial also delved into advanced topics such as interfaces and exception handling.
Tim demonstrated excellent teaching skills and provided clear explanations of complex concepts. His expertise and guidance were instrumental in my Java learning journey, enabling me to confidently apply the acquired knowledge to develop these programs.

### Acknowledgment
I would like to express my gratitude to Tim for creating such an informative and engaging Java tutorial. His dedication to teaching and expertise in the subject matter greatly contributed to my understanding and proficiency in Java programming. I highly recommend this tutorial to anyone starting their journey into Java and Object-Oriented Programming.
